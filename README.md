# My-Projects
Here is my entire life's work.


Some notes: 

VKBot:
  opBot.py is the file that works (the rest were just experiments). Breaks when coming across video posts, comments are disabled, and just after making a second comment.) 
  UPDATE: uncleSam.py = opBot 2.0; uses iteration, more robust/efficient 

pygame_notes:
  Space Invaders game, see if you can find the easter egg (still working on it btw)


7v7 Console Football game:
  My final project for my AP Computer Science class, pretty cool

SpaceScienceExperimentation:
  Following tutorials from Astroniz "Space Science with Python" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNvIBWkEdZ2iCc8G9dvx6MQvBruJG-TE8
